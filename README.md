# Engagement-P-L-Dashboard-📊 Profit & Loss (P&L) Dashboard — Power BI Case Study

🧠 Executive Summary

This P&L dashboard was designed to monitor profitability at the client level and provide leadership with clear visibility into cost structure, margins, and savings opportunities.

The primary objective was to validate how much profit each client engagement generates and identify opportunities to strategically reinvest those profits into operational improvements — reducing dependency on assigned budgets while maximizing value delivery.

The dashboard transforms raw financial and resource allocation data into actionable insights for management decision-making.

🎯 Business Objective

Client engagements were generating revenue, but leadership lacked a centralized system to:

-Track profitability per client

-Monitor labor and operational costs

-Validate margins in real time

-Identify reinvestment opportunities

-Optimize budget allocation

The goal was to create a transparent financial performance dashboard that supports smarter budgeting and growth planning.

❗ Problem Statement

-Financial data was scattered across reports
